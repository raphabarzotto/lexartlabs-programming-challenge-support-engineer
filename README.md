- To run the challenge, use a code runner extension in VSCode
- Results will show in console and should be like this:
![result](/images/results.png)
- Code is in `challenge.js`
  - I used Javascript
  - A simple forEach to filter letters and numbers
    - To make sure the letters array has only string with letters, I used regular expressions (`/^[A-Za-z]+$/`)
